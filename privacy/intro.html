        		<h4>Optional Always-On Private Browsing</h4>
        		<p>Use Epic in normal and private browsing mode, or keep Epic in an always-on private browsing mode.</p>

        		<h4>No Tracking</h4>
        		<p>Epic blocks eleven different ways from ID numbers to server-based services which are used to know what you browsed</p>

        		<h4>One-Click Encrypted Proxy</h4>
        		<p> Click the red open socket icon to turn on Epic's built-in Encrypted Proxy. This hides your
                IP address and encrypts all your data when you want to be very private. Turn the Encrypted Proxy on/off at the far right of the address bar.  Please make sure to enable Epic's Encrypted Proxy / VPN via the Extensions page. </p>

        		<h4>Ads, Trackers, Fingerprinters & Third-party Cookies Blocked</h4>
        		<p>Trackers are companies that track where and what you browse on the internet. They may associate your online data with offline data and sell your data and or use it to show you targeted ads.  Epic was the first and is still the best browser that actively blocks thousands of trackers. Please make sure to enable Epic's Ad Blocker via the Extensions page. </p>

        		<h4>Integrated Video Downloading</h4>
        		<p style="width: 275px;">Use the download arrow button at the top right of Epic to download videos and audio from hundreds of websites including YouTube, Vimeo, Soundcloud, Facebook and many others.  For some sites such as YouTube, Epic creates a download button in the webpage itself.</p>

        		<h4>Search Protection</h4>
        		<p>Epic protects your searches from being saved and tracked. Epic automatically loads search engines via its built-in proxy because search engines track you by your IP address.</p>

        		<h4>Encrypted Data Preference</h4>
				<p>If available, Epic will use <br />
				an https version of the
				website(s) you visit so<br />
				that data sent and
				received is encrypted.</p>

        		<h4>Unified Umbrella Button with Granular Controls</h4>
				<p>In case a site you visit doesn't
				work, you may need to adjust Epic's<br />

				settings for that particular website.
				Click on the umbrella icon and try<br />
				turning off one or more of Epic's
				settings for that site to make<br />
				it load correctly.</p>
