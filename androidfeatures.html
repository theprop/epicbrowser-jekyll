<p>Not able to install the Epic Privacy Browser from the Android Play store? <a href="https://cdn.epicbrowser.com/android/500508015.apk"> Download the Epic Privacy Browser APK here</a>.  You may need to modify the settings in your Android device to allow installation of apps from outside the Play Store.</p> 
<br>
<p>• Built on Chromium for Speed and Security.</p>

<p>• File Vault. Encrypt any files you download or store on your Android device to protect your privacy.</p>

<p>• AdBlocker. Install it for free via the Epic Extensions store. Epic was the first browser to block cryptomining scripts and now offers that protection to Android users. Epic's AdBlocker blocks ads, trackers, cryptomining scripts, popups and more.</p>

<p>• Free Encrypted Proxy (VPN for the browser). Install our Proxy for free via the Epic Extensions store. Our Encrypted Proxy is essentially a free, unlimited VPN for the browser powered by hundreds of servers in eight countries including the United States🇺🇸, Canada🇨🇦, the United Kingdom🇬🇧, France🇫🇷, Germany🇩🇪, the Netherlands🇳🇱, and Singapore🇸🇬.</p>

<p>• Audio Queue. On the road? Going for a run? Add webpages to Epic's audio queue and Epic will read the articles to you. Epic is the first-ever web browser to use Android's text-to-speech support for this accessibility feature.</p>

<p>• Fingerprinting Protection. Epic blocks multiple fingerprinting techniques used by data collectors.</p>

<p>• Encrypted Connection Preference. Epic tries to connect to websites using an encrypted connection whenever possible.</p>

<p>• Easy Menu-based "Close All Tabs & Delete Data" Option.</p>

<p>• Granular, Site-Based Privacy Settings Controls. If a site isn't working, you can disable ad & tracker blocking (if you've installed adblocker) as well as other privacy protections. If a site is slow or questionable, you can disable scripts for a site (note this is an advanced setting that may suppress some or all site functionality depending on the website).</p>

<p>• Tracker Count. See how many trackers are blocked in your browsing sessions when the AdBlocker is installed (typically thousands!).</p>

<p>• Bookmark Support.</p>

<p>• Password Saving Support. Optional for sites of your choice.</p>

<p>• Reader Mode Button. Convert pages to text-only for easy reading.</p>
  
<p>• Customized Dials on the New Tab Page. Set each dial on Epic's new tab page to one of your choice. No browsing history to report on your "most visited sites".</p>
<br>
<p>Try Epic. We think you'll love the faster, more private and convenient "Epic" browsing experience.</p>
