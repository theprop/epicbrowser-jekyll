    		How Epic's Encrypted Proxy (VPN) Encrypts Your Data & Protects Your IP Address and Location.<br />

<br>
    <div class="h5">
When Epic's Encrypted Proxy is on, the data between your browser and our servers is encrypted protecting it against snooping by your Internet Service Provider (ISPs), employers, governments and others. Websites won't see your real IP address or location (unless they use plugins which is increasingly rare).

			<li id="li">Authentication Requests.  Note that many websites including Facebook, Gmail & others may ask for additional authentication (because they think you're in the location of the proxy server which is likely a new location for you hence the sites' additional security measures).
			</li>
            <li id="li">Proxy White-List.  You can white-list websites from Epic's encrypted proxy in case a site isn't loading or to stop additional authentication requests.
